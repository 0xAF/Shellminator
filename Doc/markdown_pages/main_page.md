@mainpage Shellminator library

![](logo.png)

Shellminator is a simple to use library and helps to interface with VT100 compatible
terminal emulators like [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/), [Terraterm](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en) or [minicom](https://linux.die.net/man/1/minicom).
With this library you can create user friendly command line interfaces for your embedded projects.
Shellminator has history support, that means you can brows your prevoius commands with the arrow keys on the keyboard.
The library is Arduino compatible out of the box, but if you want to use it with other platforms,
you just have to implement an [Arduino compatible Serial library](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/communication/serial/).
Configuring the library is just a few minutes, and this documentation shows how to do that correctly.
