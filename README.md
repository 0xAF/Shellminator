# Shellminator

Shellminator is a simple to use terminal interface library. You can use it with any __VT-100__
terminal emulator like [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/), [Terraterm](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en) or [minicom](https://linux.die.net/man/1/minicom).
With this library you can create user friendly command line interfaces for your embedded projects.
Shellminator has command history support, that means you can browse your previous commands with the arrow keys on the keyboard.
The library is Arduino compatible out of the box, but if you want to use it with other platforms,
you can do that in Shellminator-IO source files.

__Key changes in V1.1:__
* Full arrow key support.
* Delet key functionality.
* Abort key( ctrl+c ) functionality.
* Commander-API support:
    * Command complete with tab key.
    * No need for execution function.
    * Command highlight.
